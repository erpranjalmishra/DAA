# DAA Class Labs

## Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of various algorithmic problems covered in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The programs demonstrate different algorithmic techniques such as searching, sorting, matrix manipulation, and optimization problems.

## Files Description
Below is a brief description of the Java programs included in this repository:

1. **code.java**
2. **code2.java** 
3. **code3.java**
4. **code4.java** 
5. **code5.java** - Rotates an array `k` times using the reverse technique.
6. **code6.java** - Checks if all elements in an array have a pair; includes an alternative approach using HashMap. Also contains additional implementations:
   - Product of array elements except for the current position.
   - Setting matrix elements to zero based on given conditions.

## How to Run
To execute any of the programs, follow these steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if not already installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the Java files are stored.
4. Compile the program using the command:
   ```sh
   javac filename.java




**Prerequisites**
Java 8 or later

Basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures
